The 'Butterfly Toolkit No1: Building Bridges contains all the elements and know how in order to run a peace mapping campaign in your country. It is based on our experiences with the Building Bridges peace campaign held in Kenya in 2010. It includes a number of elements, such as a 'How to do it yourself', a case study, the technical components for a Ushahidi Joomla! website and the graphics you might need. All accompanied by simple guidelines. See here for more information on the total Toolkit.

The 'Joomla component for Ushahidi' is a series of modules that re-expose the Ushahidi front page separately. The application also contains a number of technicaI Joomla extensions to enable Joomla to execute Ushahidi source code. The Ushahidi platform is a tool to easily crowdsource information using multiple channels, including SMS, email, Twitter and the web. The Joomla! component focuses on mapping positive events and social change, it also creates a platform to follow the long term aspects of a project.

It is published as an Open Source project on Github. Interested developers can co-develop BPM to improve and enhance the component. Others can download the latest version to implement it into their Joomla powered website and start sourcing information from the crowd. See here for the demo version. http://butterflytoolkitno1.buildingbridges.co.ke
